# Projects
My name is Wasiur Rahman, and this is my portfolio. After learning Python, I decided to broaden my skills and delve into data science, learning the libraries Python has to offer that allows for data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning. I hope to further my learning by working at a professional setting in the near future. Below are some of the projects I've done. 

### Project 1: Exploring Machine Learning Algorithms
* Worked with different fundamental algorithims such as linear regression, classification, and clustering
* Performed analysis on real datasets, as well as creating mock data for interpretation.
* Used the sklearn, pandas, and matplotlib library to clean data, perform analysis, and plot results.
Below is an example of a clustering exercise, where mock data was created and then grouped.

### Project 2: Weather Web App 
* Used the Flask library in Python to create a web application.
* Designed the webpage with HTML and CSS
* Connects with the OpenWeatherMap Api to retrieve real-time weather information for different cities.
* Stores the cities the user searches in an SQLite Database, to be easily viewed when the application is closed and opened later.

### Project 3: Analyzing Text with Natural Processing
* I downloaded book reviews off the internet, and trained a model to predict if a text could be positive or negative.
* The training data features the textual review, and a rating out of five stars. These two pieces of informations were used by the model.
* The model uses the sklearn library to turn words in vectors, which can be used for model training. 
* The model achieved an 85% accuracy on testing data, and can also predict whether a text is good/bad on user input.

### Project 4: Neural Networks with Tensorflow
* The MNIST dataset of 60 000+ images of handwritten digits were used to train a convolutional neural network in Tensorflow
* Icon images of size 28 x 28 pixels are first loaded in grayscale, flattened into a one-dimensional array of 1 x 784, and then passed into the model.
* The model achieved a 98% accuracy on training data
The image below shows a sample of the training data.

### Project 5: Analyzing Sales Data with Pandas and MatplotLib
* Real-world sales data was used for analysis
* The pandas library was used to clean the data, as well as extract relevant information
* Important information was graphed, and analyzed, to see what products sold the most, and what times were the busiest.
