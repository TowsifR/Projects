# Projects
My name is Towsif Rahman, and this is my portfolio. After learning Python, I decided to broaden my skills and delve into data science, learning the libraries Python has to offer that allows for data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning. I hope to further my learning by working at a professional setting in the near future. Below are some of the projects I've done. 

### Project 1: Tic Tac Toe AI
* Tic Tac Toe game created with Python that allows the user to play against an AI
* The AI works by considering all possible moves and future moves by the user, coming up with the optimal solution.
* In moving optimally each turn, it is impossible to win against the AI
